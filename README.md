Recipe app with custom recipe uploads. This project is part of [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann)'s [JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/), and only built by me for learning purposes.

The main aim of this project was to practice Asynchronous JS, OOP JS and the MVC design pattern.
