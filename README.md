Recipe app with custom recipe uploads and a bookmark option to save your recipes of choice. User-uploaded recipes are automatically saved as bookmarks in the browser's local storage, along with the recipes bookmarked manually.

This project is part of [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann)'s [JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/), and built by me for learning purposes.

The main aim of this project was to practice OOP JS, Asynchronous JS, and the basics of the MVC design pattern. Meaning this project is not 100% optimized for use, as it still lacks some important features, such as data validation before form submission.
