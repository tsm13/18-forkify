# forkify üç¥ v.1.0

Recipe app with custom recipe uploads. This project is part of [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann)'s [JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/), and only built by me for learning purposes.

The main goal of building this project was to practice OOP JS + handling API responses.
